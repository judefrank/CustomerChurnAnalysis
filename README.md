### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following business actions are recommended:

1. Encourage Long-Term Contracts:
Offer discounts or incentives for customers to move from monthly to yearly contracts.
2. Improve Onboarding Experience:
Reduce early churn by enhancing support and engagement during the first 3â€“6 months.
3. Review Pricing Strategy:
High monthly charges were linked with higher churn, especially for low-tenure usersâ€”consider bundling or discounts.
4. Target At-Risk Customers:
Use predictive churn scores to prioritize customer retention campaigns and personalized outreach.
5. Digital Payment Engagement:
Promote use of auto-pay or credit card payments which are associated with lower churn compared to electronic checks.
